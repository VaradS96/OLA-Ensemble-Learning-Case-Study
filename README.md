Ola, a popular ride-sharing platform, wants to keep its drivers happy and prevent them from leaving. They have noticed that many drivers stop working for them, which causes problems for the company and its customers. To solve this, Ola plans to use the data they have about their drivers to figure out why some of them leave. They'll use special computer programs to analyze this data and predict which drivers might leave next. Then, they'll use this information to give those drivers extra support and rewards, hoping they'll stay with Ola for longer.
